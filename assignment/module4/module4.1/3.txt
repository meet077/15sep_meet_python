Q-3 What is the difference between OOP and POP?

Ans.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) :

* OOP treats data as a critical element in the program development and does not allow it to flow freely around the system.
*In OOP, the major emphasis is on data rather than procedure (function).
*It ties data more closely to the function that operate on it, and protects it from accidental modification from outside function.
*OOP allows decomposition of a problem into a number of entities called objects and then builds data and function around these objects.
*The data of an object can be accessed only by the function associated with that object. However, function of one object can access the function of other objects.
*C++, Java, Dot Net, Python etc are the example of Object oriented programming (OOP) language.

Characteristic of Object Oriented Programming :-

* Emphasis is on data rather than procedure (function).
* Programs are divided into objects.
* Functions that operate on the data of an object are ties together in the data structure.
* Data is hidden and cannot be accessed by external function.
* Objects may communicate with each other through function.
* New data and functions can be easily added whenever necessary.
* Follows bottom up approach in program design.

Features of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) :-

1. Class
2. Object
3. Encapsulation
4. Abstraction
5. Inheritance
6. Polymorphism

Procedural Oriented Programming (POP) :

* In the procedure oriented approach, large programs are divided into smaller programs known as functions.
* In POP, a program is written as a sequence of procedures or function.
* In POP, each procedure (function) contains a series of instructions for performing a specific task.
* During the program execution each procedure (function) can be called by the other procedures.
* To call a procedure (function), we have to write function name only.
* While we concentrate onto the development of functions, we give very little attention to the data that are being used by various functions.
* In POP, the major emphasis is on procedure (function) and not on the data. 
* In a multi-function program, many important data items are placed as global so that they may be accessed by all the functions. Each function may have its own local data.
* Global data are more vulnerable to an accidental change by a function. In a large program it is very difficult to identify what data is used by which function.
* Examples of procedural oriented programming language are COBOL, FORTRAN, PASCAL, C programming language etc.

Characteristics of procedure-oriented programming:-

* Large programs are divided into smaller programs known as functions.
* Most of the functions share global data.
* Data move openly around the system from function to function.
* Functions change the value of data at any time from any place. (Functions transform data from one form to another.)
* It uses top-down approach in program design.

Difference between OOP and POP:

	OOP			POP

*Object oriented.		*Structure oriented.
