Q : 9 What is save Point? How to create a save Point write a Query?

Ans. 

Savepoint in SQL :

* Savepoint is a command in SQL that is used with the rollback command.

* It is a command in Transaction Control Language that is used to mark the transaction in a table.


To create a table in the database, first, we need to select the database in which we want to create a table.
->USE se;  

Then we will write a query to create a table named student in the selected database 'se'.
-> CREATE TABLE student(ID INT, Name VARCHAR(20), Percentage INT, Location VARCHAR(20), DateOfBirth DATE);

Now, we will write a single query to insert multiple records in the student table:
->INSERT INTO student(ID, Name, Percentage, Location, DateOfBirth) VALUES(1, "Manthan Koli", 79, "Delhi", "2003-08-20"), (2, "Dev Dixit", 75, "Pune", "1999-06-17"), (3, "Aakash Deshmukh", 87, "Mumbai", "1997-09-12"), (4, "Aaryan Jaiswal", 90, "Chennai", "2005-10-02"), (5, "Rahul Khanna", 92, "Ambala", "1996-03-04"); 

To verify that multiple records are inserted in the student table, we will execute the SELECT query.
->SELECT *FROM student;  

To use the TCL commands in SQL, we first need to initiate the transaction by using the BEGIN / START TRANSACTION command.
->START TRANSACTION;  

We will save our initiated transaction using the SAVEPOINT command along with some specific names of this savepoint.
-> SAVEPOINT ini;  

Here, we have saved the initiated transaction with the name of 'ini'.

Then, we decided to insert a new record with an ID of 10 into the existing student table.
-> INSERT INTO student VALUES (6, "Saurabh Singh", 54, "Kashmir", "1989-01-06"); 

We will execute the SELECT query to verify that the new record with ID as ten is inserted successfully.
-> SELECT *FROM student; 
 
To save the transaction with this newly inserted record, we will create a new savepoint.
-> SAVEPOINT ins;  

Here, the newly inserted record table is saved with the savepoint named 'ins'.

To update the record in the student table and set the updated name as 'Mahesh Kuwar' for the record whose ID is 1, we will execute the following query:
->mysql> UPDATE student SET Name = "Mahesh Kuwar" WHERE ID =1;  

 To verify that the record's name field with ID as 1 is updated successfully, we will again execute the SELECT query.
