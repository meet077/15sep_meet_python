Q : 3 What is Difference between DBMS and RDBMS?

Ans.

Database Management System (DBMS) is a software that is used to define, create and maintain a database and provides controlled access to the data. 

Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is an advanced version of a DBMS. 

Diffrence between DBMS and RDBMS:

DBMS :

-> Data elements need to access individually.
-> No relationship between data.
-> Normalization is not present.
-> DBMS does not support distributed database.
-> It stores data in either a navigational or hierarchical form.
-> It deals with small quantity of data.
-> Data redundancy is common in this model.
-> It is used for small organization and deal with small data.
-> It supports single user
-> Low sofware and hardware necessities.
-> Examples : XML, Window Registry,etc.

RDBMS:

-> RDBMS stores data in tabular form.
-> Multiple data elements can be accessed at the same time.
-> Normalization is present.
-> RDBMS supports distributed database.
-> It deals with large amount of data.
-> Keys and indexes do not allow Data redunda
-> It supports multiple users.
-> Data fetching is fast because of relational approach.
-> There exists multiple levels of data security in a RDBMS.
-> Higher software and hardware necessities.
-> Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, Microsoft Access etc.
