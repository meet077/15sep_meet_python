Q : 10 What is trigger and how to create a Trigger in SQL?

Ans.

A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically runs when an event occurs in the database server. DML triggers run when a user tries to modify data through a data manipulation language (DML) event. DML events are INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements on a table or view. These triggers fire when any valid event fires, whether table rows are affected or not.

Syntax:

create trigger [trigger_name] 
[before | after]  
{insert | update | delete}  
on [table_name]  
[for each row]  
[trigger_body] 
Explanation of syntax:

1.create trigger [trigger_name]: Creates or replaces an existing trigger with the trigger_name.
2.[before | after]: This specifies when the trigger will be executed.
3.{insert | update | delete}: This specifies the DML operation.
4.on [table_name]: This specifies the name of the table associated with the trigger.
5.[for each row]: This specifies a row-level trigger, i.e., the trigger will be executed for each row being affected.
6.[trigger_body]: This provides the operation to be performed as trigger is fired.

BEFORE and AFTER of Trigger: 

BEFORE triggers run the trigger action before the triggering statement is run. AFTER triggers run the trigger action after the triggering statement is run.
